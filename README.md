# Dino_pygame
This is a python pygame called the dino run or the chrome dino run. But this game is integrated with MySQL and Matplotlib. It also stores the data in csv files. It can help students understand these concepts better in these topics. Thank you!

This was my informatics technology project in class 12 and it has helped me a lot with a fun learning experience.
Hope this interests you.
This project gets user name input and stores the final score of the player for each run and stores them in a csv file. It also generates a graph for that select user so that they may check their progress in the form of a line graph( Done using matplotlib ).
You must connect to MySQL using appropriate arguments,create a table with a score and name column, download proper modules through command promt(ie using "pip install <module name>"), and download the proper images and load them onto python( suggesting to store the images is a file namely resources).
